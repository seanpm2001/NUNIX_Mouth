# NUNIX Mouth

`🧠️👄️ The Mouth component of NUNIX, a set of oral supplements and improvements. This project contains several sub-components`

> _Part of the [:octocat: `NUNIX operating system project`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/NUNIX/)_

## Summary

NUNIX mouth is a set of components for controlling and enhancing mouth usage. Several parts are enhanced, including the jaw, lips, lungs, and possibly even teeth. Some components (such as the voicebox) are close, but not related to this project. All of these components may be split off.

<!--
## Debate

It is currently being debated whether NUNIX should have this much power in controlling the mind, and how this can work as a fallback. This feature, and its components may be abandoned/reworked if it is determined to pose an existential risk.

## Components

- None at the moment
- Other/coming soon
